    <strong>Navigating opinions</strong>
    <p>
      It can be frustrating to watch an argument as an outsider. It seems
      obvious where all parties are coming from — why don’t they see it? Often,
      we find ourselves in one of the parties, feeling attacked, misunderstood,
      and patronized. Often, we don’t even realize we are returning the favor.
      They just don’t seem to get it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Trying to identify, short-circuit and avoid unproductive arguments seems
      more important than ever. 24/7 access to streaming discourse makes for
      harder to regulate base emotional states.
      <br />
      <br />When we correctly identify an opinion as poor, we are often asked
      for our more reasonable stance. If Ben trades stocks based on the phase of
      the moon, Ben has a stupid trading strategy. I don’t need to have a better
      strategy to realize this. We should be empowered to discard incoming
      opinions without having a better one of our own.

      <br />
      <br />Paying attention to the shared identity (religion, race, gender,
      ideology) of similar-opinion holders can help identify bias. In this way,
      it is also useful to observe what the characteristics of those that agree
      with you are. If you think Javascript is the best programming language,
      and so do all your classmates from your Javascript bootcamp — something’s
      fishy.

      Most people don’t actually understand how a fridge works — they thought up
      a simplified model of a fridge using their interactions with fridges. This
      model serves its purpose well, and their food stays fresh. Simplified
      models miss a lot of very important details. When two people disagree
      about how much energy is wasted keeping the fridge door open for too long,
      these missing details get filled intuitively. Our disputants “get” the
      fridge. They will disagree strongly. Having successfully used a fridge for
      decades, surely their model is the correct one? Neither of them have real
      information on how much energy the fridge spends on cooling the air inside
      it, and their models give them false confidence.

      Our opinions are often hastily formed as we face new situations.
      Discerning whether these opinions are merely quick fixes to our limited
      understanding is important, and so is noticing when others hold opinions
      formed this way. Asking if your opinion emerged instinctively when a
      situation demanded it can help. When someone presents an opinion that
      "make sense" to them, probe further. Always try to identify the true roots
      of important opinions.

      <br />
      <br />
      Nobody holds an opinion which doesn’t make sense from their point of view.
      If you find yourself unable to explain why someone would believe an
      opinion besides them being stupid or morally corrupt, there is likely
      important missing information. When we doubt our opponent's mental
      facilities, so too should we doubt our empathy for their point of view.
      <br />
      <br />
      Disagreements and arguing are pointless if all parties do not come in with
      a mind willing to change. When we find ourselves repeating the same circle
      of discourse, we should take another look at how willing everyone is to
      change their mind. Learning to disengage when we notice another hour of
      back and forth would lead to the same place is a great way to save an hour
      of time.
