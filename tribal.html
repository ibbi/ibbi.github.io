    <strong>Disagreeing poorly</strong>
    <p>
      As an outsider, it can be painful to watch groups harbor ill-will and talk
      past each other, succumbing to our worst instincts. As an insider, it
      hurts to be sorely misunderstood, and feel unheard, and to feel hated. It
      can feel rewarding, even justified, to return the favor.

      I’m from Kashmir. I have many Indian friends. I grew up in Saudi Arabia
      but became an adult in America, and have a boatload of Arab and Jewish
      friends. I’ve strongly blah blah should i say this paragraph?<br />
      <br />It is much easier to identify incorrect opinions than correct ones.
      If someone says their stock trading strategy is informed by their morning
      mood, a better trading strategy isn’t required to know theirs is flawed.

      <br />Humans like to understand how things work using simplified models
      built using interactions and intuitions. Most people don’t fully
      understand how a refrigerator works -– they just understand how it will
      behave in different situations using their simplified model of it. The
      model serves its purpose well most of the time, and allows for effective
      usage of the fridge.
      <br />
      <br />
      Simplified models miss a lot of important details, and often make
      incorrect extrapolations. If Tribe X and Tribe Y are in conflict, members
      form models of both tribes informed by information around them. When Tribe
      X acts, the act is seen through different models. Models use shortcuts,
      fill in blanks, and extrapolate. We are left with very different
      motivations and interpretations of the same action, and a worsening
      conflict.
      <br />
      <br />If an opinion is shared by people with a common prior experience
      (which informed their model, like race, religion, gender, etc) the model
      they share is likely biased. Thinking about what priors those who share an
      opinion have can help identify biases.<br />
      <br />
      Opinions make a lot of sense to those that hold them. If an opinion is
      labeled dismissively (stupid, evil, etc), the labeler is missing a lot of
      information and taking lazy shortcuts. Productive discourse is marked with
      a desire to understand the other point of view. It is also requires all
      parties to be open to changing their mind.
