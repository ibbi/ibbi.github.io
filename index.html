          I was born in Malaysia to Kashmiri parents and raised mostly in Saudi
          Arabia. I moved to America for college and started my first company,
          Proats, which sold custom liquid meals to campus athletes who, like
          me, found nutrition tracking a pain. This paid for tuition.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I graduated, I spent a year living out of my backpack, busing
          around America. By the end of that year I ended up in San Francisco,
          met a few founders, and figured out what I wanted pretty quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned to code, joined
          <a href="https://lunchclub.com" target="_blank">Lunchclub</a> early,
          and learned a ton working with really smart people. Within two and a
          half years I was running four engineering teams, and we had
          facilitated millions of meetings. When it became clear the company
          wasn't going to grow much further, I helped pivot it to
          <a href="https://lighter.xyz" target="_blank">Lighter</a> and then
          left to figure out what I wanted to do next.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then I've been investing in friends' companies (most notably
          <a href="https://cognition.ai" target="_blank">Cognition</a>,
          <a href="https://sesame.com" target="_blank">Sesame</a>,
          <a href="https://prosper.org" target="_blank">Prosper</a>,
          <a href="https://modal.com" target="_blank">Modal</a>) and helping get
          other peoples' ideas off the ground (<a
            href="https://ami.app"
            target="_blank"
            >Ami</a
          >, <a href="https://indent.com" target="_blank">Indent</a>,
          <a href="https://moderncapital.com" target="_blank">Modern Capital</a
          >).
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the way, I've found a constant source of energy from teaching
          and supporting outlier kids. That's what gives me life. Most recently
          that's taken the form of
          <a href="https://foundation.is" target="_blank">Foundation</a>.
