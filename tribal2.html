    <strong>Disagreeing poorly</strong>
    <p>
      It is difficult to watch groups fight over an opinion when we see both
      points of view from the outside. It seems obvious where all parties are
      coming from – why don’t they see it? Often, we find ourselves in one of
      the parties, feeling attacked, misunderstood, and patronized. Often, we
      don’t even realize we are returning the favor to the poor sod on the other
      end of our vitriol. They just don’t fucking get it.

      As a Kashmiri with Indian friends, a highschool PC gamer with die-hard
      console friends, a Muslim with Jewish friends, a former League of Legends
      addict, I’ve seen discourse become problematic from many angles. With 24/7
      access to discourse, short circuiting and avoiding shitty disagreements is
      more important than ever.
      <br />
      <br />When we identify an opinion as incorrect or biased, there is often
      pressure to clarify our stance. If I find out you trade stocks based on
      the phase of the moon, I do not need a more correct trading strategy to
      discard yours, and save my brainspace from pollution. I will simply ignore
      your strategy, and live a better life for it. We should feel empowered to
      discard incoming opinions without having a better one of our own.
      <br />
      <br />If an opinion is shared by a group of people with a strong shared
      prior (religion, race, gender, ideology), there is likely a lot of shared
      bias. In this way, it is also useful to observe what the characteristics
      of those that you share an opinion with are. If you think Javascript is
      the best programming language, and so do all your classmates from your
      Javascript bootcamp – something’s fishy. This form of identification is
      helpful to me on issues where priors play a huge role, like the Palestine
      conflict.

      Most people don’t actually understand how a fridge works – they thought up
      a simplified model of a fridge using their interactions with fridges. This
      model serves its purpose well, and their food stays fresh. Simplified
      models miss a lot of very important details. When two people disagree
      about how much energy is wasted keeping the fridge door open for too long,
      these important details get filled intuitively. Our disputants “get” the
      fridge. They will disagree strongly. Having successfully used a fridge for
      decades, surely their model is the correct one? Neither of them have real
      information on how much energy the fridge spends on cooling the air inside
      it, and their models give them false confidence.
      <br />
      <br />Many of our opinions form this way as we encounter situations.
      Finding a way to determine whether an opinion’s source is a quickly filled
      gap in a simple model helps to discard poor opinions. Did the opinion feel
      intuitive as soon as it made sense to form it, or do we know why we hold
      it? Does the person presenting the opinion to you have it because it just
      “makes sense”, despite being asked for more reasoning?<br />
      <br />
      Nobody holds an opinion which doesn’t make sense from their point of view.
      If you find yourself unable to explain why someone would believe an
      opinion besides ad hominems like stupidity or moral corruption, there is
      likely important missing information. When we doubt our opponent's mental
      facilities, so too should we doubt our empathy for their point of view.
      <br />
      <br />
      Disagreements and arguing are pointless if all parties do not come in with
      a mind willing to change. When we find ourselves repeating the same circle
      of discourse, we should take another look at how willing everyone is to
      change their mind. Learning to disengage when we notice another hour of
      back and forth would lead to the same place is a great way to save an hour
      of time.
