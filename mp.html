    <strong>Microplastics: No Longer a "Maybe"</strong>
    <p>
      <br />
      <strong>It’s Already Inside Us</strong><br />
      Microplastics are not just an environmental problem affecting nature.
      They’re in our blood

      >. Every human tissue scientists have tested so far has come back
      contaminated. In diseased tissue samples of people with chronic illnesses
      (IBD

      >), microplastic prevalence is significantly higher than healthy tissue.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>The Trajectory Is Clear</strong><br />
      Every new study finds higher microplastic concentrations in human tissue
      than the last. Most recently, a 50% increase in brain tissue microplastic
      prevalence over the past 8 years
      <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39901044/" target="_blank">[9]</a
      >. The burden on the human body is compounding: what we take in today
      stays with us for decades, and future generations are born contaminated.
      That’s not even mentioning nanoplastics, which we weren’t able to detect
      until 10 years ago

      <strong>What the Mice Tell Us</strong><br />
      Mice exposed to higher doses of microplastics develop gut inflammation

      But the global plastic load is increasing exponentially, and the gap is
      closing. <br /><br />
      <strong>Humans Can’t Afford 1% of That</strong><br />
      Even a fraction of the effects we induce in mice appearing in people is a
      global health crisis. That’s not hypothetical; our tolerance for risk is
      far lower than a lab rat. Mice don’t need to perform demanding physical
      and cognitive tasks 40 hours a week to survive. The accumulation math is
      also worse: mice don’t live 80 years, don’t have pregnancies lasting nine
      months, and don’t accumulate microplastics for decades. We do.
      <br /><br />
      Waiting for government intervention before acting is the same mistake we
      made with lead, asbestos, and PFAS. Let’s not do that again.
