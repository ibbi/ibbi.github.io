    <strong>Spreading ideas</strong>
    <p>
      The most dangerous ideas are the ones that feel right immediately. When
      someone presents you with a view that slides perfectly into your mental
      model, that's not validation — it's a red flag. What spreads isn't what's
      true, but what fits people's existing beliefs.
      <br /><br />
      This explains a lot of otherwise puzzling phenomena. It explains why smart
      people can hold obviously wrong views about complex conflicts based purely
      on their background. It explains why your uncle is so confident about
      everything. It explains racism. Ideas spread not because they're correct,
      but because they're easy to believe and share.
      <br /><br />
      The real tragedy is that everyone thinks they're being logical. But if you
      find yourself unable to steel-man your opponent's position — to explain
      their view in terms that they would agree with — you're probably the one
      missing something. This is especially true when you notice your views
      align suspiciously well with your demographic group. The more an idea
      confirms what you already believe, the more carefully you should examine
      it.
      <br /><br />
      Consider how ideas spread on social media. A complex analysis of the
      Israel-Palestine conflict will get far fewer shares than a tweet saying "X
      group is clearly evil." The latter spreads not because it's true, but
      because it's easy to understand and matches what certain groups already
      believe.
      <br /><br />
      QVC sells products by matching people's intuitive but incorrect models of
      how things work. A water filter commercial shows red dots pulsing in
      someone's head, then cool water washing over their brain, "curing" the
      headache. It works because it maps perfectly to how headaches feel.
      <br /><br />
      In each case, what matters isn't truth — it's how easily the idea slots
      into existing beliefs. The more an idea confirms what a group already
      thinks, the faster it spreads within that group. That's why the same
      political arguments tend to cluster by demographic. It's not that
      different groups have different access to facts. It's that they have
      different models of what makes sense.
